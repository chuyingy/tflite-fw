# TensorFlow Lite for Firmware  
[TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) ([TFLite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro)) is developed using the C++11 programming language. However, in the scenario of firmware development, the C programming language is used more.
This project attempts to convert the TFLite Micro model into C code. Allow machine learning to be applied in more firmware environments (such as more types of microcontrollers, BIOS of personal computers).  
  
> Concepts for the project have previously been posted on the [Edge AI Taiwan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/edgeaitw/) community (which is a Facebook group) and on SIG Micro's [Gitter chat channel](https://gitter.im/tensorflow/sig-micro).
